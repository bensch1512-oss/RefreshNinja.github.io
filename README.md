# Refresh Ninja – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-11-04

## Overview
Refresh Ninja does not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal data. All functionality runs locally in your browser.

## Data We Process
- Selected tab IDs, refresh interval, and on/off state are stored locally using `chrome.storage.local`.
- The extension uses `chrome.tabs` only to list open tabs and reload the ones you explicitly select.
- The extension uses `chrome.alarms` to trigger periodic refreshes at your chosen interval.

No page content, browsing history, cookies, or personal information is read, stored, or transmitted.

## Data Sharing
We do not share data with third parties. No analytics or tracking is used.

## Permissions Rationale
- Tabs: List/reload only the tabs you select.
- Storage: Remember your selections and timer locally.
- Alarms: Schedule refreshes without keeping the extension active.

## Children’s Privacy
This extension is not directed to children and collects no personal information.

## Changes to This Policy
If this policy changes, we will update this page and the “Last updated” date.
